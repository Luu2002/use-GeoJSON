# use-GeoJSON

I want to share my life path through an interactive and visually appealing map on this website. I methodically constructed a digital depiction of the places that have shaped my existence, from the beginning to the present, using the power of GeoJSON technology.

You will see the key moments in my lifeÂ as you follow this map. Beginning with my birthplace and the town where I grew up, each site is labeled with its own coordinates, giving a concrete link between the events of my life and the actual world.

Warning! This page is under construction and will not include every detail of my life path.
